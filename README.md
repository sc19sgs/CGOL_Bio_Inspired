# CGOL_Bio_Inspired

## Overview
This project implements Conway's Game of Life (CGOL) integrated with Bio-Inspired Computing principles. It simulates an ecosystem with two types of entities: Mice (Prey) and Wolves (Predators). Users can interactively place these entities on a grid and observe their interactions based on our predefined rules.

## Features
- Interactive grid for placing Mice and Wolves
- Start, Pause, and Reset the simulation
- Custom rules that mimic natural predator-prey dynamics, such as:
    - *We need to mention our adaptations here later

### Requirements
- PIL 
- Numpy 
- Tkinter

## Tutorial:
1.) Run the CGOL.py script

2.) Place Mice (Prey) in grid and/or Wolves (Predators) using left-click and shift + left-click respectively

3.) Press "Start Game" and observe the simulation using our rules
